&lt;p>Recently, I had the chance to work in the CLion environment, so I decided to test it out in the context of Embedded development. I used CLion for a mini-project for university in C++, and it was great to write in, so I figured it would be worth trying it out for an Embedded project too. My experiences with different IDEs for Embedded, like CubeIDE, CrossStudio, or VSC with extensions, haven&amp;rsquo;t been too impressive so far (they were okay, but something was always missing). I usually work with STM32 processors. The goal was to see if CLion makes debugging and code writing easier (one IDE without extra editors). I also wanted to avoid using OpenOCD (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always seem like a stable solution to me – I&amp;rsquo;ve had bad experiences debugging Zephyr on Windows).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
